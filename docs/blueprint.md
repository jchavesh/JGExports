## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Cacao Gold (#C9A36A) for warmth and association with cacao beans and luxury.
- Background color: Light desaturated coffee brown (#F2EBE6) to create a professional and calm impression. A background that evokes a light paper texture can further enrich the visual experience.
- Accent color: Jungle Green (#2E6B4E), inspired by the rich Costa Rican nature and invoking brand trust. Consider using this to highlight key action items, important data, or text of crucial relevance to the app's use.
- Headline font: 'Alegreya', a humanist serif that balances elegance, knowledge, and modernity.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a neutral sans-serif to promote legibility.
- Minimal and modern line icons in accent color.
- Subtle fade-in and slide-up animations on scroll; parallax effect on hero images.
